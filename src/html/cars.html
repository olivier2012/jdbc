    <h2>The most expensive cars</h2>
    <p>
        The number of supercars and hypercars is growing at a fast clip. That means competition for the most expensive car in 
        the world title is also growing. From the Lamborghini Veneno Roadster to the McLaren P1 to the Aston Martin Valkyrie, 
        expensive, high-ticket rarities are crowding the top of the market. Surprisingly, a most expensive car list is not as 
        easy to make as you might think. The prices for the most expensive cars fluctuate depending on customer build requests, 
        which-among the buyers of the world's most expensive cars-can get rather baroque.

To assemble the list, one has to filter out the wide spectrum of suspect vapor, such as the late Marussia, 
the Zenvo TS1, and the Icona Vulcano Titanium, and instead went with cars that have established sales, something of a 
history, and at least partially verifiable base prices-Lamborghini, McLaren, Bugatti, and Pagani, and Koenigsegg, among others.

In the list of the most expensive cars there are also cars that come from unexpected places, such as the Lykan Hypersport, a controversial,
ultra-low-volume speed demon that is the first supercar to emerge from the Middle East.

    <h3>Lamborghini</h3>

    <p>
        Poison. That�s the name Lamborghini chose for the modified Aventador you see above � translated from Spanish of course � built
        to celebrate the automaker�s 50th birthday. It's hard to speak for the company�s motivations, but the name is fitting for a 
        vehicle that looks so positively deadly, so undeniably venomous.
The car is absolutely stunning from every angle, and it looks like an alien spacecraft surveying our planet 
for eventual takeover. It just doesn�t seem real. The only thing more remarkable than the look is the price � a whopping $4.5 million.
The Veneno is fast, and that should come as no surprise. Its 6.5-liter V12 spins all the way up to 8,400 rpm to deliver 740 hp and 507 lb-ft,
surging the car to 60 mph in 2.9 seconds.
    </p>
    
    <p>
         A list like this is also notable for what didn't make the cut - the Hennessey Venom GT Spyder WRE ($1.3 million), 
         Lamborghini Centenario ($1.8 million), and Aston Martin Vulcan ($2.3 million).
    </p>
    <p>
        The most expensive cars in the world are about so much more than transportation. These rolling art pieces encapsulate the priorities
        of the 1% , and in that universe, flamboyance and swagger take precedence over practicality and efficiency. 
        Lifestyle criticisms aside, these are truly mind-boggling machines.

So whether your name is Buffet, Gates, Bezos, or McDuck, these rides are for you � the most exorbitant people-carriers on the planet.
They say money can�t buy happiness, but after viewing this list, you just might beg to differ.

    <h3>Lykan Hypersport</h3>
    <img  id="picture_2" src="./img/Lykan.jpg" style="float:right; width:400; margin: 2mm;" />
    <p>
        You may recall the Lykan Hypersport from its starring role in the blockbuster Furious 7, where the Lebanese supercar crashed
        through not one, not two, but three skyscrapers in Dubai. In a franchise filled with high-end exotics and one-off custom creations,
        the fact that the Hypersport got so much focus is a testament to its magnetism.
Let�s start with the styling, which includes jewel-encrusted headlights, scissor doors, and an interior ripped straight from science fiction.
It looks like a pissed off armored car from the future, and its performance is right on par with its image. The Hypersport boasts a 3.7-liter,
twin-turbo flat-six that yields 770 hp and 708 lb-ft.
It�s not just Dominic Toretto who benefits from this level of performance, though, as the Abu Dhabi police force has drafted the Hypersport 
into patrol duty. Although it�s mainly used for marketing and public relations purposes, the high-flying stunner assures that the authorities 
can keep up with any baddie who tries to get cute on the freeway. Pedal to the floor, 0 to 62 mph is accomplished in just 2.8 seconds, 
and top speed is a downright scary 240 mph.

    <h3>Bugatti</h3>
    <img id="picture_3" src="./img/Bugatti.jpg" style="float:left; width:400;  margin: 2mm;" />
    <p>
        This list wouldn�t be complete without some version of the mighty Bugatti Veyron. For example, the Mansory
        Vivere edition here, because not only is it one of the fastest cars in the world, it�s one of the most expensive.
Augmented by German witch doctors Mansory, the 1,200-hp Veyron starts out as a Grand Sport Vitesse Roadster, only to be adorned with a 
gorgeous carbon-fiber body, a new spoiler package, upgraded LED lights, a revamped cabin, and a redesigned front grill. Further 
classifying the Veyron as a work of art, maps of historic race events like the Targa Florio are laser etched into the exterior and 
interior. Oh, and it can do 254 mph.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Pagani</h3>
    <img  id="picture_4" src="./img/Pagani.jpg" style="float: right; width:400;  margin: 2mm;" />
    <p>
        With an AMG-sourced V12 and the second fastest road-legal Top Gear lap ever, the Pagani Huayra is a beast through and through � 
        it�s named after the Incan God of Winds, after all. That wasn�t quite enough for Pagani, however. At the 2016 Geneva Motor Show, 
        Pagani debuted the Huayra BC, a lighter, hotter version that takes no prisoners.
Right off the bat, you can tell the BC is playing a different game from the standard Huayra. It�s fitted with an enormous active rear spoiler
that generates 1,102 pounds of downforce at 155 mph, as well as a wider rear track, new side skirts, and a bevy of sexy aero goodies. 
Despite the additions, the BC is a true featherweight, tipping the scales at a paltry 2,654 pounds thanks to the extensive use of carbon 
fiber and other lightweight materials. The whole deal will cost you a cool $2.6 million 
(or it would have, if all 20 units hadn�t sold already),but you clearly get a lot for your money. With 789 turbocharged ponies on tap,
the BC may actually live up to its godly name.

        The Pagani Huayra (Italian pronunciation: ['wai ra]) is an Italian mid-engined sports car produced by Pagani. 
        Succeeding the company's previous offering, the Zonda, it had a base price of �850,000. It is named after Huayra-tata, a 
        Quechua wind god.[1][2] The Huayra was named "The Hypercar of the Year 2012" by Top Gear magazine and received a very positive 
        review when tested by Richard Hammond on Top Gear. The Huayra was previously the fastest road car to go around the Top Gear Test 
        Track, setting a time of 1:13.8, beating the previous record of 1:15.1 set by the Ariel Atom V8 in January 2011, and also placed 
        above other hypercars such as the Aston Martin Vulcan, Bugatti Veyron 16.4, Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport, Ferrari Enzo Ferrari, 
        Koenigsegg CCX, Lamborghini Sesto Elemento, and Pagani Zonda F. It is also unofficially faster around the track than the Ferrari 
        LaFerrari. However, in June 2016, the Huayra was beaten by the McLaren 675LT that set a record of 1:13.7.
On February 11, 2015 it was reported that the Pagani Huayra has been sold out. The Huayra was limited to just 100 units as part of Pagani's
agreement with engine supplier Mercedes-AMG.
